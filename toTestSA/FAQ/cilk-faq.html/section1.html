<h2><A name="whatiscilk">
Question 1.1.  What is Cilk?
</A></h2>

Cilk is a language for multithreaded parallel programming based on
ANSI C.  Cilk is designed for general-purpose parallel programming,
but it is especially effective for exploiting dynamic, highly
asynchronous parallelism, which can be difficult to write in
data-parallel or message-passing style.  Cilk has been developed since
1994 by the Supercomputing Technologies Group at the MIT Laboratory
for Computer Science.  Cilk has been used for research, teaching, and
for coding applications such as a virus shell assembly simulator and
three chess programs.  
<h2><A name="whereiscilk">
Question 1.2.  How do I obtain Cilk?
</A></h2>

Official versions of Cilk can be found at
<A href="http://supertech.lcs.mit.edu/cilk">the Cilk web page</A> 
<p>
We briefly used SourceForge, but they don't know how to stop SPAM, and
eventually gave up.  
<h2><A name="whereiscilk">
Question 1.3.  Are there Cilk-related mailing
lists?
</A></h2>

Yes.  Look for Cilk at <A href="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge (www.sourceforge.net)</A>.  Three mailing lists exist: 
<ul>
<li><A href="mailto:cilk-users@lists.sourceforge.net"><code>cilk-users@lists.sourceforge.net</code></A> is an open discussion list for Cilk users.  
<p>
However, the Cilk users mailing list is not monitored by the current
Cilk developers because of spam.  The list is probably useless now. 

<li><A href="mailto:cilk-announce@lists.sourceforge.net"><code>cilk-announce@lists.sourceforge.net</code></A> is a read-only, low-traffic mailing list where we announce new releases of
Cilk.  
<li>Use the <A href="mailto:cilk-support@lists.sourceforge.net"><code>cilk-support@lists.sourceforge.net</code></A> mail alias to send mail to a restricted set of Cilk developers. 

</ul>

<h2><A name="iscilkfree">
Question 1.4.  Is Cilk free software?
</A></h2>

Starting with version 5.3, Cilk is Free Software in the technical
sense defined by the Free Software Foundation (see
<A href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html">Categories of Free and Non-Free Software</A>), and is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.  Previous versions of Cilk were
distributed without fee for noncommercial use, but were not
technically ``free.'' 
<h2><A name="systems">
Question 1.5.  Which systems does Cilk run
on?
</A></h2>

The current Cilk-5.3 system runs on systems that support
POSIX threads.  In particular, Cilk has been installed
successfully on GNU/Linux, Solaris, IRIX, Digital Unix, and MacOS X. 

<p>
Cilk requires certain system software in order to run.  In particular,
it requires a recent gcc, GNU make, and preferably the GNU linker. 
GNU/Linux systems are usually distributed with all these tools.  Cilk
should also work on other systems (*BSD etc.) whenever the appropriate
tools are installed.  If you successfully compile Cilk on these
systems, please contact me <A href="mailto:bradley@mit.edu"><code>bradley@mit.edu</code></A> so that I can update this FAQ.  
<p>
Cilk-5.3 supports IA-32 (x86), IA-64 (Itanium), AMD64 (x86-64)
PowerPC, SPARC, MIPS, and Alpha processors.  Porting to other
processors is not difficult.  Please contact
<A href="mailto:cilk-support@lists.sourceforge.net"><code>cilk-support@lists.sourceforge.net</code></A> if you are interested in running Cilk on other machines.  
<h2><A name="runOnNOW">
Question 1.6.  Does Cilk run on networks of
workstations?
</A></h2>

Cilk-5.3 does not run on distributed-memory machines.  Keith Randall
wrote a distributed-memory variant of Cilk-5.1 as part of his
Ph. D. thesis.  See <A href="http://supertech.lcs.mit.edu/cilk">the Cilk web page</A> for a copy of the thesis and for downloading the distributed-memory Cilk version.  Be
warned that this version is experimental and it has not been updated
in a long time.  
<h2><A name="runOnDOS">
Question 1.7.  Does Cilk run on Windows NT?
</A></h2>

Please do not send questions about Windows NT to the cilk-support
mailing list, because the Cilk maintainer does not know anything about
this system.  
<h2><A name="cilkchess">
Question 1.8.  What is Cilkchess?
</A></h2>

Cilkchess is a chess program written in Cilk.  Cilkchess and Cilk are
two distinct things. Cilkchess has never been released, and it is not
part of the Cilk distribution.  For more information about Cilkchess,
contact its author Don Dailey <A href="mailto:drd@supertech.lcs.mit.edu"><code>drd@supertech.lcs.mit.edu</code></A>.  <hr>
